// react has 2 types of components
// [1] class based components 
// [2] function based components 

// earlier class based functions were used but now function based components are used as they are easier 
// in function based components what u do is , u write a function App() (as in App.js), and return JSX inside of it 
// so JSX is like a unified form of html, js and css 
// JSX is HTML itselt wearing a crown of javascript 
// instead of class that we use in html, in JSX we write className to avoid the naming conflicts
// HTML for is replaced by htmlFor 

// only 1 tag may be returned from JSX, if u wanna add anything other than that above the div tag in App.js u may wrap that in an empty tag 

// example App.js
//function App() {
    // return (
       // <>  - empty tag 
      // <h1>hello this is me </h1> -- extra line u wanted u add - now wrapped 
    //     <div className="App">
    //       <header className="App-header">
    //         <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
    //         <p>
    //           Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
    //         </p>
    //         <a
    //           className="App-link"
    //           href="https://reactjs.org"
    //           target="_blank"
    //           rel="noopener noreferrer"

    //         </a>
    //       </header>
    //     </div>
       //   </>
    //   );
    // }
    
    // export default App;


    //JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to JavaScript syntax that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is commonly used in React to describe what the UI should look like.

    // we will be making a basic project

    // wher eu get a piece of string, may be to find the number of words, remove the spaces etc

    // what is deployment ?
// In the context of React applications, deployment refers to the process of making your React application accessible and available for use on the internet or a web server. When you deploy a React application, you make it publicly available for users to access, interact with, and use.
